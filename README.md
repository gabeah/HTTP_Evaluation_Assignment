# HTTP_Evaluation_Assignment
The code for the CS396: Networks Evaluation Assignment focusing on Application Layer uses

The code is split into two folders for question 1 and question 2 respectively.

This code was tested on the localhost for my chromebook. I had firewall issues when it came to recieving messages not on the localhost, so all wireshark captures are internal captures.

There is a slight bug with the code, the TCP server will recieve an empty request from the browser and will have trouble processing the request. When recieving a request from the TCP Client, there is no error.

I worked in collaboration with Sima Nerush and Emily Yu.
